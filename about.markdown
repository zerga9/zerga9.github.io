Hi! I'm a Ruby on Rails developer. I am an advocate of positive social change through the smart and responsible use of technology. I thrive when working in a team, solving challenging problems and learning new skills.

I studied Medicine and Philosophy and then became a self-taught video editor working on social and cultural projects. Although Iâ€™ve enjoyed all the work I've done, my passion for technology and problem solving motivated me to learn programming. In 2018, I graduated from Makers Academy's 12 week course and soon after began working for a global fintech company, AZA Finance.
At the moment I am working for a Customer Data Platform, Treasure Data.
