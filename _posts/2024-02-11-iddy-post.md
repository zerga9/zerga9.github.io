Hi all!

I'm Idris and I'm 8 years old. I am writing a book about a girl who's name is Lilly Python. It's in the year 1067 and her mother and father are dead. The mother died in a bomb and the father was shot by a poisoned arrow. Her mother died when she was a baby, but she knows how to avenge her father.
She escapes an orphanage (well not escaped really, got adopted unfortunately). Now I'm just about at the point of Lilly escaping the house. She has a pet corn snake Xico, who the parents found and where horrified by.
